This page is a guide on getting started with Hamster.

### Introduction

Hamster is a lightweight and easy-to-use game engine designed to help teach Python programming through the creation of games.

### Installing Hamster

Hamster is still in the early stages of development, therefore there are no prebuilt binaries or installation managers available. The Hamster library for Python will become available on pip once a stable version is released.

First clone Hamster from GitHub.
```sh
git clone --recursive https://github.com/DoritoThePug/Hamster.git 
```

Currently, in order to use Hamster, you need to build the project yourself. This can be done with the following commands:

<Tabs>
  <TabItem label="Windows" icon="seti:windows">
    ```sh
    ./scripts/setup-windows.bat
    ```
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem label="Linux" icon="linux">
    ```sh
    ./scripts/setup-linux.sh
    ``` 
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

### Using Hamster in Python

A new file will be generated following this for the Python module, this file will be named `Hamster.cpython-...`. Copy this file and paste it into the directory of your python project.

Import Hamster into your file.

```python
import Hamster
```

And voila! You will now be able to use Hamster.
