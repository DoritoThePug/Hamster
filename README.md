# Hamster

Hamster is a game engine that is intended to be used in the classroom to teach beginners Python programming. It is intuitive and simple to use. The Python api can be used by itself as a library or used together with the graphical editor (work in progress). Hamster differs from existing Python libraries which enable game creation such as PyGame in its "pythonic" design rather than the object oriented design of many libraries. It is also much easier to use and get started.

## Installation
Hamster is still in its early stages of development so installation has still not been simplified. 

### Cloning Hamster

Use the command `git clone --recursive https://github.com/DoritoThePug/Hamster.git`

### Requirements

Currently, Hamster is being developed on Linux, Hamster's builds should support Windows machines. On your machine, you need `CMake`, `Ninja` and `Clang` to build and compile Hamster.

### Building Hamster

To build and compile Hamster, go to `/Scripts` and run the os-specific setup command.
