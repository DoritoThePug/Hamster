# Hamster

Hamster is a game engine that is intended to be used in the classroom to teach beginners Python programming. It is intuitive and simple to use. The Python api can be used by itself as a library or used together with the graphical editor (work in progress). Hamster differs from existing Python libraries which enable game creation such as PyGame in its "pythonic" design rather than the object oriented design of many libraries. It is also much easier to use and get started.
